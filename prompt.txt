I am teaching Mathematics in my Math Class course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Composing transformations \uff5c Transformations in the plane \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [gYIBbDLYFY0]","number":56,"start":134.0,"end":136.32,"text":" So now if we want to multiply both of those by three halves,"},{"title":"Graphing a non similar pre-image algebraically [wkhQNXyW01U]","number":72,"start":177.82,"end":181.9,"text":" And so this is what I am saying."},{"title":"Proof\uff1a Angle between a tangent and a chord \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [hbdvuygTlMA]","number":67,"start":198.8,"end":200.88,"text":" And then if I multiply that times theta,"},{"title":"Proof\uff1a Angle formed by intersecting chords \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [nxHUx1o8-sA]","number":42,"start":121.4,"end":123.16,"text":" So the measure of this,"},{"title":"Applying similar triangles \uff5c Similarity in triangles \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [MlGOhzYn-QQ]","number":113,"start":283.62,"end":287.82,"text":" 1.65 times that side and 1.65 times that side,"}]

"why was the value of x that"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
