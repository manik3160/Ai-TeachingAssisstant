I am teaching Mathematics in my Math Class course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Rotating algebraically about a point \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [c1qJuIxXOMY]","number":144,"start":413.88,"end":416.72,"text":" And then I'm gonna take whatever my y value is,"},{"title":"Reflecting over y=-x \uff5c Transformations in the plane \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [EydeoSJ3248]","number":74,"start":199.02,"end":200.38,"text":" let me do this in,"},{"title":"Composing transformations \uff5c Transformations in the plane \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [gYIBbDLYFY0]","number":49,"start":116.28,"end":117.86,"text":" Let me do this in another color."},{"title":"Rotating algebraically about a point \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [c1qJuIxXOMY]","number":94,"start":259.88,"end":264.68,"text":" So if this point, let me do this in a red color."},{"title":"Applying similar triangles \uff5c Similarity in triangles \uff5c Geometry (TX TEKS) \uff5c Khan Academy [MlGOhzYn-QQ]","number":65,"start":174.08,"end":177.36,"text":" And then I also have, let me do this in another color."}]

"I want to know about angle between tangent and cord"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
